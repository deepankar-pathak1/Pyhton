Self keyword:
The self keyword is used in the method to refer to the instance of the current class we are using. 
The self keyword is passed as a parameter explicitly every time we define a method.

def read_number(self):
        print(self.num)
        
        
        
__init__ method:-
"__init__" is also called as a constructor in object-oriented terminology. Whereas a constructor is defined as:

"Constructor in Python is used to assign values to the variables or data members of a class when an object is created."

def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor
    
    
    
class Employee:
    no_of_leaves = 8

    def __init__(self, aname, asalary, arole):
        self.name = aname
        self.salary = asalary
        self.role = arole

    def printdetails(self):
        return f"The Name is {self.name}. Salary is {self.salary} and role is {self.role}"


harry = Employee("Harry", 255, "Instructor")

# rohan = Employee()
# harry.name = "Harry"
# harry.salary = 455
# harry.role = "Instructor"
#
# rohan.name = "Rohan"
# rohan.salary = 4554
# rohan.role = "Student"

print(harry.salary)
