In multilevel inheritance, a class that is already derived from another class is derived by a third class. 
So in this way, the third class has all the other two former classes' features and functionalities. 


class Parent1:
    pass
class Derived1(Parent1):
    pass
class Derived2(Derived1):
    pass
    
    
    class level1:
      def first(self):
            print ('code')

class level2(level1): #inherit level1
      def second(self):
             print ('with')

class level3(level2): #inherit level2
      def third(self):
            print ('harry')

obj=level3()
obj.first()
obj.second()
obj.third()

class Son(Dad):
