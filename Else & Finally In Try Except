try and except block:
In the try block, we write the code in which an exception might occur, and in except block, we write the code as a resultant if an exception occurs. 


else keyword:-
We use an else keyword to print something in cases where no exception occurs.

try:
    #Run this code
except Exception as error:
    #Execute this code when there is an exception
else:
    #No Exception. Run this code
    
    
finally:-
finally, will run in either case. It is also known as code cleaner because it will perform its action, either an exception occurs or not.

try:
    #Run this code
except Exception as error:
    #Execute this code when there is an exception
else:
   #No Exception. Run this code
finally:
   #Always run this code
   
   
   
   
In the try block, all the statements are executed until an exception occurs.
Except block is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that occurs during the execution of the try block.
Else block runs only when no exceptions occur in the execution of the try block.
Finally block always run, either an exception occurs or not.

Except   Running        Not running
Else     Will not run   Run
Finally  Will Run       Will Run
